  # This can be one of the following:

  # Generates a new user/pwd pair per builds.
  # This require that the credentials passed as database.credentials_file have GRANT permissions.
  # - static:
  # Generates a new user/pwd pair only on first build.
  # This require that the credentials passed as database.credentials_file have GRANT permissions.
  # - manual:
  # Uses the same user/pwd pair than the one found in the database.credentials_file.
  # This is useful for locked-down setups where you do not have GRANT permissions.
