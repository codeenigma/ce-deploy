# ce-deploy

A set of Ansible roles and wrapper scripts to deploy (web) applications.

## Overview
The "stack" from this repo is to be installed on a "deploy" server/runner, to be used in conjonction with a CI/CD tool (Jenkins, Gitlab, Travis, ...).
It allows the deploy steps for a given app to be easily customisable and to be stored alongside the codebase of the project.
When triggered from a deployment tool, the stack will clone the codebase and "play" a given deploy playbook from there.

## [Install](install/README.md)
The stack only gets tested on Debian Buster, but should run on any Linux distribution, as long as Ansible >=2.9 is present.
You can install either:
- through [ce-provision](https://github.com/codeenigma/ce-provision)
- manually by running a local playbook
- with Docker (soon)

### [Install with ce-provision](install/README.md#install-with-ce-provision)
### [Install manually](install/README.md#install-manually)
### [Install with Docker](install/README.md#install-with-docker)
### [Configuration](install/README.md#configuration)
## [Usage](scripts/README.md)
While you can re-use/fork roles or call playbooks directly from your deployment tool, it is recommended to use the provided wrapper scripts, as they will take care of setting up the needed environments.

### [Sync roles](roles/sync/README.md)
